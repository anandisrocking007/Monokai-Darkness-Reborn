# Monokai-Darkness-Reborn
This theme is fork of Monokai theme scheme and the base theme files have been taken from the [Monokai Dark Soda](https://github.com/rainje/Monokai-Dark-Soda) Theme

All the color schemes of the Monokai Dark soda is present but added more differnt color schemes to two or different types of code which had the same color eg:id selector and class selector were of the same color so i changed it.

The most important reason i made this theme is because of the <?php ?> tag. It used to take me time to find ?> of php when i used to look through code which i did not make or which were not well formatted so i add an unique orange background with rounded corners identifiy the begining and end of the code immediately.

#### HOPE THIS HELPS YOU:-
